# In contrast to the stats.timers 'count' metrics, the ones in 'stats'
# (no '.timer') are automatically rescaled to per second frequency by
# estatsd, so we can just use them directly (contrast to the
# http_requests_per_second_by_request_type.graph)

# Since there are potentially several HTTP status codes that can be
# returned, many of which will be low-count metrics that will
# otherwise crowd the display, we'll filter out codes that don't rise
# above a given threshold at the end of the graphed time period.
