# 0.2.8 - 2013-05-24
- Bumps oc_bifrost version to 1.1.4, which removes the global lager
  parse transform compilation flag.

# 0.2.7 - 2013-05-24
- Incorporate changes to lager configuration which reduce the
  verbosity of logging.  This is intended as a temporary work-around
  to keep us under our daily Splunk limits.
